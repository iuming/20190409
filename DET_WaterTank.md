# A Python program for Simulating a WaterTank problem based on a Dynamic Event Tree    

In the first part, I will introduce the dynamic event tree. Then, based on the dynamic event tree method, I will introduce a water tank model to apply this method. Finally, I will mainly talk about the concept of programming and the flow of the program. It will be described in both C++ and Python.
